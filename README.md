# Capstone-Project
Naughts and Crosses Python game as part of my Sigma Labs Pre-Course Capstone Project.

Play the classic Naughts and Crosses game in your terminal, against another player or yourself! 

How to play:

1) Make sure you have Python installed.
2) Navigate to the directory containing the naughts_and_crosses.py file.
   (Use the command 'cd' to change directory e.g. 
   $ cd /Users/dawiddawidowski/documents/Capstone-Project
4) Run the game by typing:
   $ python3 naughts_and_crosses

Enjoy!
